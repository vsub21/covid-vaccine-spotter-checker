# covid19-vaccine-checker

Super quick and dirty script. Checks CVS Pharamacy website every (default) 10 seconds to see if vaccines are available in Massachusetts -- plays sound if vaccine is found. Sound works on Windows only at the moment.

## Potential to-dos:
- Add other pharmacies (e.g. Walgreens, probably a different program)
- Add other OS support for sound (Mac/Linux)
- Add email notification support
- Add Twilio (text) support
- Fill in forms automatically (big stretch)
